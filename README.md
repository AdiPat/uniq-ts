# ✨ zuniq: A Custom `uniq` Implementation in TypeScript 👾

A powerful, TypeScript-based reimplementation of the UNIX `uniq` command-line tool. 🚀  
Effortlessly filter unique lines from files or standard input, sharpening your programming skills while building something useful.

Inspired by [John Crickett's Coding Challenges](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-uniq/), this project is a perfect weekend hackathon for sharpening your TypeScript chops. 🧠💻

## 📜 What Is `uniq`?

> From the UNIX manual:
>
> The `uniq` utility reads the specified `input_file`, comparing **adjacent lines**, and writes a copy of each unique input line to the `output_file`.  
> If `input_file` is `-` or omitted, it reads from standard input.  
> If `output_file` is omitted, the output goes to standard output.
>
> ✨ **Important:** Repeated lines are detected **only if they are adjacent**. To ensure accurate results, it might be necessary to sort the file before using `uniq`.
